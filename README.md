# Summer-Camp-2025

## **Welcome to Robotics Summer Camp 2025! üöÄ**

This program is designed to provide participants with an immersive and comprehensive introduction to the field of robotics. Our curriculum covers a range of topics from basic concepts to advanced applications, ensuring that each participant gains valuable hands-on experience and knowledge. We're here to steepen your learning curve and launch you into the future of robotics.

## **Camp Workflow**

To make the learning process seamless and interactive, we will be utilizing various tools and resources. The camp workflow is structured to facilitate progressive learning, starting with fundamental concepts and moving towards more specialized topics.

### Two Phases

#### Phase 1: 21 May 2025 ‚Äì 20 June 2025 (compulsory for all)
- Covers the 5 core domains (Weeks 0‚Äì5)
- You will be given resources and domain-specific tasks each week
- **Don't skip any Week task**‚Äîincomplete submissions can impact your Club entry eligibility

#### Phase 2: 21 June 2025 ‚Äì 10 July 2025
- Choose **2 specialisation tracks** of your choice among the five
- Complete the provided resources and tasks for each track within the timeline
- Make a submission to appear on the leaderboard and get a chance to enter the club

### Submission & Evaluation
- For both phases, you'll receive learning materials and challenges
- Complete **as many tasks as you can** and **submit everything you've done** (partial submissions count!)
- Submissions drive your evaluation and Weekly/Cumulative Leaderboards‚Äîso submit early and often, even if a task isn't fully finished

### Why It Matters
- Phase 1 ensures everyone has a strong robotics foundation
- Phase 2 lets you dive deep into two areas and showcase your specialized skills
- Solid, consistent submissions are key to your ranking and ultimate Robotics Club entry

## **Leaderboard üèÜ**

A leaderboard will track participants' progress and achievements throughout the camp. Points will be awarded based on the completion of tasks and challenges, with additional points available for bonus tasks. This element of gamification aims to motivate and engage participants, fostering a spirit of healthy competition.

### Weekly Releases
- We'll publish the **Weekly Leaderboard** summarising each participant's points for the previous week.

### Cumulative Summer Camp Standings
- After each week closes, we'll also update the **Overall Summer Camp Leaderboard**, so you can see your rank in the grand standings at any time.

### Phase 2 Specialisation Leaderboards
- When Phase 2 begins, each domain will have its own leaderboard.
    - The **Top 3** performers in each specialisation will earn **direct entry** into the Robotics Club's hardware events.

### Public Recognition
- All leaderboards (Weekly, Overall, and Specialization) will be published on our official Robotics Club **Instagram** ‚Äî complete with your photo and rank
- Soon, they'll also be mirrored on our official website
